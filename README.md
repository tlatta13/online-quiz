# Arsenal Football Club Quiz

## Objective
This project required us to create a function multiple choice quiz using a theme of our choosing. To do this we needed to use our knowledge of js and dom to start the quiz with a timer and move from question to question after users provided an answer.

## Project Accomplishments
* Created a quiz based around Arsenal Football Club
* Used html, css and bootstrap to design an attractive UI
* Used a timer that starts when users begin the quiz and deducts 10 seconds for any wrong answer
* Quiz moves from question to question after user answers
